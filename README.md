The project that was selected 
is a Mortgage Calculator using JavaFX.
We know the housing market rates are skyrocketing!
People are going to need to know what the new rates are.


Zach Bowman - This is the first time being
in a team and thinking of a role. I am not sure how it works.
I would like to be the one who handles the inputs of the project
and calculate/send them back to the main.
